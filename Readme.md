#AppMiWOM

This app allows you to view the web http://www.wom.cl/miwom. On this page you can see your mobile plan consumption if and only if you are using your mobile network connection, this page doesn't work with wifi

##What's the advantage of using this app?

If you are using a WiFi connection, this app detects the WiFi connection and disables it to use your mobile plan. When you close the app (going back) it automatically enables your WiFi connection and kills itself.

##What about my personal information?
This app doesn't collect any information, if you are not sure, you can see the source code ;)
